# Chapter 8 - Define the Problem

Problems usually arise when you have an undesired result -R1, but you want a desired outcome - R2. The solution is the steps taken from R1 to R2.

Technically, the method to define the problem is called <ins>continuous analysis</ins> and follows the following questions:
1. Is there/is it possible to have a problem (or opportunity)?
2. Where is the problem?
3. why does it exist (the root cause of the problem)?
4. What can we do?
5. How do we do it?
Where Q1 and Q2 define the problem, and Q3-5 is the best approach to finding the optimal solution.

## Key elements and structure

Normally, the problem indicating the gap between the undesired result and the desired outcome is caused by a certain situation or under a set of conditions.
The problem could be displayed clearly with **key elements** including:
- *Starting Point/Open Scene*
- *Disturbing Event*
- *Current Situation - R1, Undesired Result*
- *End Goal - R2, Desired Result*

**Starting Point** 

Make short assumptions or descriptions to lay out the situation.

**Disturbing Event**

The disturbing event is something happening now/ about to happen/will happen, and it poses a challenge or threat to the existing situation that is relatively stable. It includes:
- <ins>External Causes</ins>: changes that occurred outside the current structure or environment, e.g. new competitor, new technology, government policy, consumer policy changes, etc
- <ins>Internal causes</ins>: changes that occurred within the organization, e.g. new SOP, technology adoption, entering a new market, product line adjustment, etc.
- <ins>other reasons</ins>: evidence shows possible changes, e.g. lack of product performance, lower than average operational standard, and reports showing a shift in customer behavior, etc.

**Current Situation, R1**

R1 indicates the problem that the client is trying to solve or an opportunity that the client is trying to catch, it could be more than one and it is recommended to show as a simple description in the sketch. e.g. decreasing market share, revenue decreasing, profit loss or missing market opportunity, etc.

**End Goal, R2**

R2 is the expected outcome, give a specific or quantitative description is helpful to judge whether the end goal is achieved or not. e.g. achieving annual revenue growth by 25% more, adjusting on operational system for greater production, etc.

## Example of Sketches
As the reader follows left to right to bottom structure, there are several possible questions be posed, it could be categorized into following 7 scenarios:
